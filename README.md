### Hi, I'm Absolute Narwhal
- Just a guy who likes to code in his free time.
- I'm interested in low level programming such as in compilers, VMs and game engines.
- Sometimes I make video games in Godot.
- My favourite language is Rust but I usually code in C++. I also regularly use Python for certain projects.
